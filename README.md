# Malware-Classification-using-Malimg-dataset

## Problem Defination:
    Malware is any malicious code or a program that can be harmful to the computer. 
    There are many types of malwares, and itâ€™s essential to detect these types to prevent their breaches to keep the data and the system private and secured.

## Dataset:
    - The Malimg dataset consists of 9339 images and 25 classes. 
    - The dataset contains the family/class of the malware and the malware type.
